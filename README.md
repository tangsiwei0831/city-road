# Initiative
Here is the original vue version [repo](https://github.com/anvaka/city-roads/tree/main) which I follow. When I first see the city road repo, I think it is a fantastic website. As I would like to try to understand the core of the repo and would like to learn react a little bit, with the help of Copilot, I build a simpler react version of the city road website which hosted on Github Page. 

If anyone has interest, please go to the original repo and sponsor that!

# Command

`npm create vite @latestcity-road -- --template react`

`npm i`

`npm run dev`

`npm run deploy`


# Github Page Deployment
check [repo](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages), noted that I am using vite so vite.config.js needs add base, check [here](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html)
